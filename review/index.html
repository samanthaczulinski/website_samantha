        Winter is my favourite season of the year. </p>

    <p> Compared to the other seasons, winter is my top pick. The crisp, freshly-fallen, white snow covers the ground and trees, creating that postcard picture. The sun, shining brighter than ever before, means you have to squint your eyes, shielding them. You roll out of bed, get dressed and leave to school half awake. The moment your boot comes in contact with the snow, and your lungs fill with the frigid air, you are awake. Walking to school after the first snow, is like stepping into a new reality. The icicles hang off the edges of roofs, the snow sits on the fickle branches  and threatens to bombbard you from above if you dare alk underneath it. As you admire the changes, and walk in your own isolated bubble of thought, reality pops it when you least expect it. Your brown boots that you bought last week preparing for the snow fail you, and you introduce yourself to ice on the pavement.   </p>
